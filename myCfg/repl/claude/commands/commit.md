description: Create git commit(s) with proper message(s)
---
## Context

- Current git status: !`git status`
- Current git diff: !`git diff HEAD`
- Recent commits: !`git log --oneline -5`

## Task

Analyze the changes and create commit(s) based on the context:

1. **Multiple commits when**:
   - Changes span multiple logical concerns (e.g., feature + refactor + docs)
   - Changes affect unrelated components or modules
   - User explicitly requests multiple commits or groups of changes

2. **Single commit when**:
   - All changes relate to a single logical unit of work
   - User specifies a single context or scope
   - Changes form one cohesive story

3. **Context-limited commits**:
   - If instructed to commit specific files/paths, ONLY stage and commit those files
   - Respect explicit scope boundaries provided by the user
   - Do NOT include unrelated staged or unstaged changes

Each commit message MUST follow Conventional Commits syntax: `type(scope): description`

When creating multiple commits:
- Stage and commit related changes together
- Use descriptive, focused commit messages for each
- Maintain logical ordering (dependencies first)
