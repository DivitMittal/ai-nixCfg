# Code Quality Rules

## General
- Prefer pure functions over side effects
- Keep functions small and focused
- Avoid deep nesting (max 3-4 levels)
- Use early returns to reduce indentation

## Error Handling
- Handle errors explicitly
- Provide helpful error messages
- Fail fast and loud in development
- Never silently swallow errors
